This is a collection of classes and methods that I have found useful or interesting. This code set is a constant
work in progress and updates happen frequently.

Abstract Classes:

- Graph: forms the standard two-dimensional cartesian coordinate plane.

Object Classes:

- ApplicationWindow: represents a GUI window for an application.
- Clock: creates simple clocks suitable for presentation inside an application window.
- EventHandler: simple mechanism for providing event hooks to objects like ApplicationWindow and Plugin.
- Parabola: a subclass of Graph which models a quadratic equation using the standard parabola curve.
- Plugin: represents plugins that allow third parties to extend the functionality of an application.
- RichTextPane: creates text panes for applications with rich formatting capabilities and built-in file I/O.

Static classes:

- Games: contains utility methods useful for games, animated applications, and applications accompanying games.
- Support: contains utility methods for validating data, displaying special GUI components, and more.

Interfaces:

- Pluggable: allows applications to be extended by Plugin objects.
